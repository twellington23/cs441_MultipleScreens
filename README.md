# cs441_MultipleScreens
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

This project is meant to be a game that implements a use of multiple screens.

In this game random shapes will appear on screen and you will have to perform a simple action on each shape to get it to disappear from the screen before time runs out. Tapping the info button in the bottom right corner will bring up the instructions for how to remove each shape (different shapes require different actions). Tapping the button again will bring you back to the game screen.
